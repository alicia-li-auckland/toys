# Actual Work Data Guide - No Schedules Required

## 🎯 **Focus: Real Construction Activity Only**

Instead of comparing against schedules you may not have, let's focus on **actual work being done** and track **real construction progress**.

## ✅ **Redesigned KPIs - Schedule-Free**

### **📊 Current KPI Cards (Based on Actual Work)**

1. **Overall Progress** - `completed_tasks / total_tasks * 100`
2. **Active Work** - Count of tasks currently `in-progress`
3. **Work Velocity** - Tasks with activity in last 7 days ÷ 7
4. **Work Quality** - Percentage of tasks without defects/rework
5. **Trade Coverage** - Percentage of trades actively working
6. **Problem Areas** - Count of stagnant + behind + abandoned locations

### **🎯 No More "Unknowns" - All Metrics from Real Data**

## 📋 **Recommended Data Fields (Actual Work Focus)**

### **🏗️ Core Work Tracking (Priority 1)**
| Field | Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `location` | String | Where work is happening | `DCH-L1` |
| `trade` | String | Type of work | `Electrical` |
| `state` | String | Current work status | `in-progress` |
| `capture_date` | Date | When data was collected | `2024-08-01` |
| `last_activity_date` | Date | Last day work occurred | `2024-07-30` |

### **📊 Progress & Quality (Priority 2)**  
| Field | Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `percent_complete` | Number | Granular progress | `75.5` |
| `quality_rating` | Number | Work quality score | `95` |
| `rework_count` | Number | Defects requiring rework | `1` |
| `progress_notes` | String | Current work status | `Conduit installation ongoing` |

### **👥 Crew & Resources (Priority 3)**
| Field | Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `crew_size` | Number | People working today | `4` |
| `supervisor_name` | String | Who's responsible | `Johnson` |
| `work_hours_today` | Number | Hours worked today | `8` |
| `area_sqft` | Number | Work area size | `1200` |

## 📈 **What Each KPI Actually Measures**

### **1. Overall Progress** ✅
- **Calculation**: `(Complete tasks / Total tasks) × 100`
- **Data needed**: Just `state` field
- **Shows**: How much work is actually done

### **2. Active Work** 🔵  
- **Calculation**: Count where `state = 'in-progress'`
- **Data needed**: Just `state` field
- **Shows**: Current work volume

### **3. Work Velocity** 📈
- **Calculation**: Tasks with `last_activity_date` in last 7 days ÷ 7
- **Data needed**: `last_activity_date` or `capture_date`
- **Shows**: Daily work pace (no schedule comparison needed)

### **4. Work Quality** 🏆
- **Calculation**: `(Tasks without rework / Total tasks) × 100`
- **Data needed**: `rework_count` or `quality_rating`
- **Shows**: First-time-right percentage

### **5. Trade Coverage** 🔧
- **Calculation**: `(Trades with active work / Total trades) × 100`
- **Data needed**: `trade` + `state` fields
- **Shows**: How many trade types are actively working

### **6. Problem Areas** ⚠️
- **Calculation**: Count of stagnant + behind + abandoned locations
- **Data needed**: `state` + `last_activity_date`
- **Shows**: Locations needing attention

## 🚀 **Implementation Steps**

### **Phase 1: Basic Activity Tracking**
Start with fields you probably already have:
```csv
location,trade,state,capture_date,building,level
```

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Activity**
Add these for better insights:
```csv
+ percent_complete,last_activity_date,progress_notes
```

### **Phase 3: Quality & Resources**
Add for comprehensive tracking:
```csv
+ quality_rating,rework_count,crew_size,supervisor_name,work_hours_today
```

## 📊 **Sample Data Structure**

```csv
location,trade,state,capture_date,percent_complete,quality_rating,rework_count,crew_size,supervisor_name,work_hours_today,last_activity_date,progress_notes
DCH-L1,Electrical,in-progress,2024-08-01,75,0,1,4,Johnson,8,2024-07-30,Conduit installation ongoing
DCH-L2,Plumbing,complete,2024-08-01,100,90,1,3,Davis,0,2024-04-05,One leak repair needed
MYD-L1,Mechanical,in-progress,2024-08-01,85,0,0,5,Thompson,8,2024-07-29,Equipment installation proceeding well
```

## 🎯 **Key Benefits of This Approach**

### **✅ What You Get**
- **Real progress tracking** - based on actual work completed
- **Activity monitoring** - see which areas are actively working
- **Quality insights** - track defects and rework without baselines
- **Resource visibility** - understand crew deployment
- **Problem identification** - spot stagnant or troubled areas

### **❌ What You Don't Need**
- ~~Planned start dates~~
- ~~Scheduled completion dates~~
- ~~Budget baselines~~
- ~~Earned value calculations~~
- ~~Schedule variance reports~~

## 🔍 **Smart Problem Detection**

### **Stagnant Work** 
- Logic: `state = 'in-progress'` BUT `last_activity_date > 7 days ago`
- Shows: Work that started but stopped

### **Quality Issues**
- Logic: `rework_count > 0` OR `quality_rating < 85`
- Shows: Areas needing quality attention

### **Low Velocity Areas**
- Logic: No recent `last_activity_date` across multiple trades
- Shows: Buildings/floors with slow progress

### **Resource Gaps**
- Logic: `crew_size = 0` BUT `state = 'in-progress'`
- Shows: Work assigned but no crew
