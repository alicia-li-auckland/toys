# Option 1 - Self Service
## Construction Project Onboarding Accelerator

### Overview
This prototype demonstrates a **Self Service** approach to construction project onboarding that reduces setup time from 4 weeks to 2 weeks through an intelligent three-panel interface.

### Key Features

#### 🎯 **Core Value Proposition**
- **AI-powered schedule parsing** with human oversight
- **Trade identification** from ambiguous terminology (e.g., "SOG" → "Concrete Pour")
- **Noise filtering** to exclude non-trackable items
- **Progressive learning** that improves with customer-specific corrections

#### 🏗️ **Three-Panel Interface**

1. **📥 Input Panel (Left)**
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - Supports: P6 (.xer), MS Project (.mpp), Excel, PDF, Images
   - Building type templates (Data Center, Residential)
   - Template customization

2. **🤖 AI Parsing Panel (Center)**
   - Real-time schedule parsing
   - Confidence-scored AI suggestions
   - Accept/Reject/Edit controls
   - Excluded items management
   - Learning system for customer terminology

3. **📊 Output Panel (Right)**
   - Gantt chart visualization
   - Floor plan mapping
   - Project summary statistics
   - Export capabilities

### Technical Implementation

#### File Processing
- **Real file parsing**: Reads actual XER, CSV, and text files
- **Smart extraction**: Identifies construction activities vs. administrative tasks
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for unsupported formats

#### AI Intelligence
- **Trade mapping**: Keyword-based classification system
- **Confidence scoring**: 60-99% accuracy indicators
- **Learning system**: Customer-specific terminology dictionaries
- **Batch processing**: Handle large schedules (10,000+ items)

#### User Experience
- **Progressive disclosure**: Information revealed as needed
- **Immediate feedback**: Real-time processing indicators
- **Error recovery**: Restore excluded items, edit mappings
- **Customer handoff**: Same interface for internal setup and customer approval

### Demo Instructions

1. **Access the prototype**: 
   ```

   ```

2. **Try the workflow**:
   - Upload a schedule file (any text file will work for demo)
   - Select a building template
   - Review AI parsing suggestions
   - Accept/reject/edit mappings
   - View the generated Gantt chart

3. **Key interactions to test**:
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - Template selection (Data Center vs Residential)
   - AI suggestion accept/reject buttons
   - Tab switching in output panel
   - File removal and excluded item restoration

### Success Metrics

#### Primary KPIs
- ⏱️ **Setup time**: 4 weeks → 2 weeks
- ✅ **First-pass accuracy**: >80%
- 👍 **Customer approval rate**: >90%

#### User Experience
- **Processing speed**: 500-page schedule in <30 seconds
- **AI accuracy**: 85%+ after 3 customer projects
- **Usability**: Single-page app with keyboard shortcuts

### Implementation Phases

#### ✅ Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-2)
- Three-panel interface
- Basic schedule parsing
- Manual trade mapping
- Simple Gantt output

#### 🚧 Phase 2: Intelligence (Months 3-4)
- AI trade recognition
- Confidence scoring
- Customer-specific learning
- PDF schedule support

#### 📋 Phase 3: Spatial (Months 5-6)
- Floor plan upload
- Manual location zoning
- Activity-to-location assignment
- Visual progress tracking setup
